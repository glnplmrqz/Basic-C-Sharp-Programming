--- C# Programming Language Notes ---
• IDE -> a software used by a developer so that they can easily code in a certain programming language, IDE has tons of features that makes programming easier.

• Console.WriteLine();
-> used to display something in the console.

• Console.Write();
-> used to display something in the console on the same line.

• // - Single Line Comment
• /* /* - Multi Line Comment

• $ string interpolation -> provides a more readable and convenient syntax for composite formatting by allowing you to embed variable expressions directly within a string literal. 
* Sample:
	$"Hello, {name}"

• Variables -> are used to store up temporary data to be used in our program's runtime.

• Data Type -> type of data inside our variable.

* Data Types
1. Characters -> char (Holds a Single Character)
2. String -> string (Holds a Set of Characters/Texts)
3. Boolean -> bool (Holds True or False)
4. Integers
-> int (- 2,147,483,648 to - 2,147,483,647)
-> long (- 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
5. Floating Point
-> float (6/7 decimals) (with f in the end)
-> double (15 decimals)

• Identifiers -> is the name of the variable that the programmer indicated and used to read and write inside the variable.

• Rules of Identifiers
1. You cannot use any special character other than underscore(_).
2. You cannot use whitespaces.
3. You cannot use numbers alone.
4. You cannot use numbers to be the first character of the identifier.
5. You can use numbers but with letters.

• Declaring Variables
Syntax for Declaring Variables:
1. datatype identifier;
2. datatype identifier = value;
3. datatype identifier 1, identifier2;
4. datatype identifier 1 = value, identifier 2 = value; 

• Reassigning Variables
Syntax for Reassigning Variables:
identifier = value;

• Concatenation -> the process of joining strings together with the plus operator.
PS: You can concatenate inside a variable or on the WriteLine statement.

• User Input
1. Console.ReadLine()-> used for inputting a string.
2. Console.Read() -> used for inputting a character by pressing enter in the keyboard.
3. Console.ReadKey().KeyChar -> used for inputting a character by pressing a letter in the keyboard.

• DataType Conversion -> is the act of converting one datatype to another.
1. Type Casting -> assigning a value of one datatype to another datatype.

* Two Types of Casting
1. Implicit Casting -> converting a smaller type to a larger type size and done automatically.
char -> int -> long -> float -> double
2. Explicit Casting -> converting a larger type to a smaller size type and done manually by using the parentheses with the datatype in it.
double -> float -> long -> int -> char

2. Conversion methods -> uses a built-in method to convert datatypes from one type to another and especially strings.
- Convert.ToInt32() -> integer
- Convert.ToInt64() -> long
- Convert.ToSingle() -> float
- Convert.ToDouble() -> double
- Convert.ToString() -> string

• Arithmetic Operators
1. Addition -> + (sum)
2. Subtraction -> - (difference)
3. Multiplication -> * (product)
4. Division -> / (quotient)
5. Modulus -> % (remainder)
6. Increment -> ++ (plus 1)
7. Decrement ->  -- (minus 1)

• Assignment Arithmetic Operators (Shorthand Operators)
1. Addition -> += (sum)
2. Subtraction -> -= (difference)
3. Multiplication -> *= (product)
4. Division -> /= (quotient)
5. Modulus -> %= (remainder)

• Arrays -> is a collection of multiple values in a single variable with the same datatype they are governed by using an index.
• Elements -> are the individual values in an array.

• Declaring Arrays
1. Declare with values
-> datatype[] identifier = {val1, val2, val3};
2. Declare without values
-> datatype[] identifier = new datatype[size];

• Index -> is a number that represents a position in a collection and always starts from zero.

• Accessing Arrays
Syntax for Accessing Arrays:
1. identifier[index]; -> Reading Array Element
2. identifier[index] = value; -> Assigning Array Element
3. identifier[index] = Console.ReadLine(); -> Assigning Array Element with User Input

• Conditional Statements 
-> allows a program to take action based on the given condition and makes our program smarter.
-> it compares two values so that our program can decide what action should be taken.

• Relational Operators
1. Equals -> ==
2. Not Equals -> !=
3. Less than -> <
4. Less than or Equals -> <=
5. Greater than -> >
6. Greater than or Equals -> >=

1. If Statement -> handles 1 conditional expression, it either does something or nothing. 
Syntax For If Statement:
	if(condition) {
		// Do Everything you want here
	}
2. If-Else Statement -> handles 2 conditional expressions, it either does the first code block or the second code block.
Syntax for If-Else Statement:
	if(condition) {
		// Do Everything you want here
	}else{
		// Do Everything you want here
	}
3. Else-If Statement -> handles 3 or more conditional expressions, the possibility of this statements are limitless it will run a certain code block based on the condition.
Syntax For Else-If Statement:
	if(condition) {
		// Do Everything you want here
	}else if() {
		// Do Everything you want here
	}else{
		// Do Everything you want here
	}

• Nested Conditional Statement -> a conditional statement within a conditional statement.
PS: The nested conditional statement can be any type of conditional statement.
* Syntax For Nested Conditional Statement:
	if(condition) {
		if(condition) {
			// Do Anything You Want Here
		}
	}

• Equals method -> identifier.Equals(value);
• Ignoring case -> identifier.Equals(value, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)

• Logical Operators
1. AND -> && (both conditions needs to be true)
2. OR -> || (either conditions needs to be true)
3. NOT -> ! (inverts the current condition)

• Switch Statement -> similar to a conditional statement but only check for equality and only works with strings, char, int, and enums.
• Case keyword -> used to define a "Case" in a switch statement.

* Syntax For Switch Statement:
	switch(expression/variable){
		case value1:
			// Do Anything Here
			break;
		case value2:
			// Do Anything Here
			break;
	}

• Default Keyword -> often used to handle values that are not on a case and is recommended that keyword is used on the end of a switch statement.

* Syntax For Switch Statement with Default Keyword:
	switch(expression/variable){
		case value1:
			// Do Anything Here
			break;
		case value2:
			// Do Anything Here
			break;
		default:
			// Do Anything Here
			break; 
	}

• Break keyword -> used to break out of a switch statement or loop statements without executing the whole block of code inside it.
PS: It is necessary in C# Programming.

• While Loop -> it is used when you want a code block to run repeatedly while a condition is met.

Syntax For While Loop:
	while(condition){
		// Do Anything Here
	}

• Iterating Arrays -> it means read every element inside an array and do something with it.
• Array Length -> you can find out the size of an array by calling their length variable (built in variable in an array)
* Syntax For Length:
	identifier.Length;

• Do-While Loop -> same as while loop but it executes the code block first before checking the conditon.

* Syntax For Do-While Loop:
	do {
		// Do Anything Here
	}while(condition);

• Break keyword -> used to break out of a loop statement earlier than it is expected to end.
• Conditions in While Loop -> you can use conditions inside a while loop for different reasons like, searching inside an array.

• For Loop 
-> is used when you want a code block to run repeatedly while the condition is met.
-> more compact format but more complicated version of a while loop and for loops are commonly used to iterate through collections like arrays.

* Syntax For Loop:
	for(initialization; condition; operation){
		// Do Anything Here
	}

• Iterating arrays - means to read every element inside an array and do something with it.
• Array Length -> you can find out the size of an array by calling their length variable (built in variable in an array)
• Break keyword -> used to break out of a loop statement earlier than it is expected to end.
• Conditions in For Loop -> you can use conditions inside a for loop for different reasons like, searching inside an array.

• For Each Loop -> are used to iterate through collections like arrays easily without knowing the size of the collection.
• Iterating arrays - means to read every element inside an array and do something with it.

* Syntax For-Each Loop:
	foreach(datatype identifier in collection){
		// Do Anything Here
	}

• Break keyword -> used to break out of a loop statement earlier than it is expected to end.
• Conditional in For-Each Loop -> you can use conditions inside a for-each loop for different reasons like, searching inside an array.

• 2D Array 
-> it's arrays within an array it basically looks like a table with rows and columns.
-> like 1D arrays, it can only store one datatype at a time.
-> rows (pahiga) & columns (patayo)

• Declaring 2D Arrays
1. Declare with values
* Syntax For Declaring 2D Arrays with Value
-> datatype[,] identifiers = {
				{val1, val2}.
				{val3, val4}
}; 

2. Declare without values
* Syntax For Declaring 2D Arrays without Value
-> datatype[,] identifiers = new datatype[rows, cols];

• Accessing 2D Arrays
1. Read Values
->  identifier[indexRow, indexCol];
2. Write Values
->  identifier[indexRow, indexCol] = value;

• Nested For Loop -> it is a for loop inside a for loop.
• Iterating 2D Arrays using For Loop -> we can use nested for loops/for each loops to iterate through a 2D Array.
PS: Instead identifier.Length, we use in iterating 2D array is identifier.GetLength(row or col).

• Iterating 2D Arrays using For Each Loop -> automatically display all the value without using nested for loop.

• Methods/functions -> used to divide and sort functionalities within a class so that the code will be readable even if its long.

* Syntax For Methods/Functions:
	modifiers returntype methodName(){
		// Do Anything Here
	}

• Calling Methods -> type the methodName();

• Variable Scoping
1. Global Variables -> are variables declared within a class, it can be accessed within the whole class.
2. Local Variables -> are variables declared inside a method, condition, loops, and any other block of code, it can only be accessible within that block of code.
3. Parameters/Arguments
-> a value that needs to be passed on a method so that the method can use that value and perform various operations on it.
PS: You can have as many arguments/parameters as you want. They act as a local variable inside a method/function.
* Syntax for Methods with parameters
	modifiers returntype methodName(parameters){
		// Do Anything Here
	}

• Return keyword -> used to return a value from the method and used when a method has a result.
Example:
-> A method that performs math equations.
-> A method that concatenates strings.

• Return Type -> the type of the value that will be returned, return type are same as the datatypes.
1. void returns nothing.
2. int returns integers.
3. string returns strings.
4. float returns floats.
5. double returns doubles.

* Syntax Methods with Return:
	modifiers returntype methodName(parameters){
		// Do Anything Here
		return value;
	}

• Overloading Methods -> you can use the same method name but different parameters so that you can cater every possibility of a method.

• Object-Oriented Programming
-> It focuses on implementing real world objects using classes to create variations of objects, that has attributes and purpose.
-> It helps us create much flexible and efficient code than procedural programming.

• Classes
-> It is created by the programmer, it will act as a blueprint of an object that you want to implement in your program.
-> They contain all the attributes and methods that your desired object should have.

• Creating Classes -> we can create classes inside our current file or create another file in the solution explorer.

• Objects -> created by instantiating a class and anything that has an attribute and a purpose.
Example: Person, Furniture, and Food

• Attributes
-> These are the global variables declared inside the class of our object.
-> It is used to create variations of an object using only one class.

• Class Instantiation
-> the process of creating an instance of a class so we can use it on our program.
PS: These can also be called objects later on.

* Syntax for Class Instantiation:
	ClassName identifier = new ClassName();

• Accessing Attributes 
1. Writing Attributes
-> identifier.attribute = value;
2. Reading Attributes
-> Console.WriteLine(identifier.attribute);

• Access Modifiers -> used to modify where classes, variables and methods are accessible.

* Access Modifiers For Classes
1. default or internal -> the class can only be accessed in the same assembly not other assemblies.
2. public -> the class can be accessed in all classes.

* Access Modifiers in Methods and Variables
1. default or private -> it can only be accessded inside its own class.
2. public -> it can be accessed in any class.
3. internal -> the methods and variables can only be accessed in the same assembly not other assemblies.
4. protected -> it can only be accessed in the same class or in a class that is inherited from that class.

• Static Methods and Variables (static) -> are methods and variables that belongs to the class itself and not the instance.
• Static Classes (static) -> are classes that cannot be instantiated and it shall only contain static methods and variables.
• Readonly Keyword (readonly) -> a keyword used so that a variable cannot be reassigned to a new value.

• Constructors
-> It is the method called when you instantiate a class/create an object.
-> It is used to initialize the attributes of an object or run a block of code when an object is created.

* Syntax for Constructors
-> Constructor method are named after their Class Name.

	modifiers ClassName class {
		modifiers className(){
			// Constructor
		}
	}

• Creating Constructors
-> Constructors are used to initialize attributes.

• This Keyword 
-> The "this" keyword refers to the class itself.
-> The "this" keyword will enables you to access global variables inside the class if you have the same variable names in a parameter.

* Example:
	public Product Class {
		public string name;
		public float price;

		public Product(string name, float price){
			this.name = name;
			this.price = price;
		}
	}

• Overloading Constructors -> is an oop technique used to create multiple constructors with different arguments, and used to cope up with the needs of a certain instance of an object.
PS: This is the same as Method Overloading

• Object Methods
-> Object Methods are methods declared inside an Object Class.
-> Object methods are considered as the object's purpose.

• Creating Object Methods
-> Object methods are same as the methods we talked about.

* Syntax for Object Methods

modifiers class ClassName {
	
	modifiers returntype methodName(parameters) {
		// Do Anything Here
	}
}

• Calling Object Methods
-> Object Methods are same as the Methods we talked about.
* Syntax for Calling Object Methods
	ClassName identifier = new ClassName(constructor);
	identifier.methodName(parameters);

• Encapsulation -> is an oop technique used to hide data from direct access.

Advantages of Encapsulation
1. It hides direct access to our variables, it also hides our implementation of how we get and set a certain value.
2. We can decide whether we want to make a variable read-only or write-only.

• Using Encapsulation -> Declare attributes as Private

1. Private = Field
2. Property = public

• Getters and Setters -> are used to get and set encapsulated variables.
1. get{return userID;} -> read
2. set{userID = value} -> write

• Using Getters & Setters
// Get
Console.WriteLine(u.UserID);
//Set
u.UserID = 1332;

• Automatic Property -> without private field and automatically encapsulated
public datatype methodName{
	get;
	set;
}

PS: Both set and get needed in automatic property.

• Inheritance -> is an oop technique used to inherit attributes, properties and methods from one class to another.

• Base Class (parent or super class ) -> the class where we will inherit the attributes and methods.
• Derived Class (child or sub class) -> the class who will inherit the attributes and methods from a base class.

• Using Inheritance -> ':' character after derived class name

* Example: 
	
	modifiers class derivedClassName : baseClassName {

		// Attributes

	}

• Overriding Constructors -> you are required to call the constructor of the superclass.
• Base Keyword (base) -> it can only be used by a derived class and it is used to call their base class so we can access their constructors, attributes, and methods.
• Overriding Methods -> to retain the functionality from the Base class use the Base Keyword to call the Method.

• Polymorphism 
-> "Poly" means MANY and Morphy means "Take Different Forms"
-> It is an oop technique that utilizes inheritance and overriding to create 1 class and make several classes inherit from that class so that it can take many forms.

• Instantiating Derived Class
-> we can instantiate derived classes using its base class.

• Virtual Modifier (virtual) -> it is used for the methods of a base class, it indicates that the method can be overridden.

• Override Modifier (override) -> it is used for the derived class methods that intends to override existing method from the base class.

• Abstraction -> it is an oop technique that hides certain details and only shows the important information.

It can be achieved in 2 ways:
1. Abstract Classes (Uses abstract modifier)
2. Interfaces (Uses interfaces)

• Abstract Modifier (abstract) -> used to mark methods or classes as abstract.

• Abstract Class -> it cannot be instantiated to access it, you need to inherit it from another class.

• Abstract Methods -> can only be declared inside an abstract class and it is a method without a body and it needs to be overridden in the derived class of the abstract class.

• Interface 
-> It is like a full abstract class that is implemented in other classes.
-> Any method you declare would be an abstract method by default.
-> No variables are allowed in the interface class.

• Array of Objects -> you can declare an array of a certain class and store instances of that class inside that array.

• Initializing Array of Objects
* Syntax:
	ClassName[] identifier = new ClassName[size];

• Storing Objects inside Array
* ClassName[] identifier = new ClassName[size];
identifier[index] = new ClassName(constructor);

• Array of Objects & Polymorphism
* Syntax: 
	BaseClass[] identifier = new BaseClass[size];
	identifier[index] = new DerivedClass(constructor);
